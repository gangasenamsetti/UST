Communication and Reasoning Exercises

41. The statement that either p or q is true, but not both is called the exclusive disjunction of p and q, which we shall write as p # q. Give a formula for p # q in terms of the logical operators --->(p^¬q)∨(¬p^q)

42. The statement that either p and q are both true, or neither is true, is called the biconditional of p and q, and write it as pq. Give a formula for pq in terms of the logical operators ---->(p^q)∨(¬p^q)

43. Referring to Exercise 41, give an example of an everyday usage of exclusive disjunction.
You can have either coffee or tea, but not both

44. Referring to Exercise 42, give an example of an everyday usage of the biconditional
    You will get a chocolate if and only if you finish your homework.
